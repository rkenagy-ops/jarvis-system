## Why Jarvis?

**🔒 Your data stays yours** - 100% local AI processing. No cloud, no subscriptions, no data harvesting. Automatic redaction of sensitive info. This is non-negotiable.

**🗣️ A third person in the room** - Unlike voice assistants that only respond to rigid commands, Jarvis understands conversations. It maintains a short temporary rolling context of what's being discussed, so when you ask "Jarvis, what do you think?" it knows exactly what you're talking about. Have it chime into discussions with friends, help debug code while you talk through problems, or weigh in on decisions.

**🧠 Never forgets** - Unlimited memory across conversations. Adapts tone naturally to the topic. Learns your preferences over time.

**🎙️ Free dictation** - Hold a hotkey, speak, release — your words appear in any app as text. Like WisprFlow, but free, offline, and private. No subscription, no cloud transcription.

**🔌 Extensible** - MCP integration connects Jarvis to thousands of tools: smart home, GitHub, Slack, databases, and more. Smart tool selection means adding more tools won't slow things down.

**📊 Transparent progress** - We track what works (and what doesn't) with automated evals. [See current accuracy →](EVALS.md)

**🚧 Known limitations:** Jarvis is under active development. Primary development happens on macOS. Windows/Linux support may lag behind. We're building in the open, [issues](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues) and [contributions](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/pulls) welcome!
- Voice-only for now—no text chat interface yet ([#35](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/35))
- No mobile apps ([#17](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/17))
- "Stop" commands during speech sometimes get filtered as echo ([#24](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/24))
- Dictation is not available on macOS 26+ (Tahoe) due to a pynput incompatibility ([#172](https://github.com/isair/jarvis/issues/172))

## System Requirements

| Hardware | VRAM | Model |
|----------|------|-------|
| Low-VRAM / CPU | 2GB+ | `qwen3.5:0.8b` |
| Most users | 8GB+ | `gemma4:e2b` (default) |
| Better quality | 16GB+ | `gemma4:e4b` |
| High-end | 24GB+ | `gpt-oss:20b` |

> **Note:** VRAM requirements include the fast model (`gemma4:e2b`) which is always loaded alongside the chat model for voice intent classification and other real-time work. The default chat model shares this, so no extra VRAM is needed.

The setup wizard will guide you through model selection and installation on first launch.

## Configuration

Most users won't need to change anything. Open **⚙️ Settings** from the tray menu to configure Jarvis through a graphical interface — no JSON editing required. Settings are saved to `~/.config/jarvis/config.json`.

<summary><strong>LLM Provider (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible)</strong></summary>

By default Jarvis runs everything locally through [Ollama](https://ollama.com): no API keys, nothing leaves your machine. If you already run an OpenAI-compatible server you can point Jarvis at it instead. Your data still only travels to the servers you control.

Pick the provider in the Setup Wizard's first step, or under **⚙️ Settings → 🔌 LLM Provider**. No JSON editing required. On the OpenAI-compatible page the wizard does the legwork for you: it auto-detects running local servers, offers a one-click preset for your app, and when you press **Connect** it loads the server's model list and checks the chosen model for chat, tool calling, and embeddings, so you know it works before you finish setup.

Tested local servers (all run on your own machine):

| App | Default base URL | Notes |
|-----|------------------|-------|
| LM Studio | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | Chat, tool calling, and embeddings. |
| Ollama (OpenAI API) | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | The native Ollama path is the default; the OpenAI shape works too. |
| Jan | `http://localhost:1337/v1` | Chat and tool calling. |
| llama.cpp (`llama-server`) | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | Tool calling depends on the model. |
| LocalAI | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | Feature support depends on the backend model. |
| vLLM | `http://localhost:8000/v1` | Tool calling depends on the model. |
| oMLX (Apple Silicon) | varies | No embeddings endpoint, so memory uses keyword search unless you route embeddings to Ollama (below). |

For reference, the underlying config keys are:

```json
{
  "llm_provider": "openai_compatible",
  "llm_base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
  "llm_api_key": "",
  "llm_chat_model": "your-served-model-name"
}
```

- `llm_base_url`: your server's OpenAI API base URL.
- `llm_api_key`: only if your server requires one; leave empty otherwise.
- `llm_chat_model`: whatever model name your server exposes.
- `fast_model` (optional): the small, quick model used for real-time work (voice intent, tool routing, quick classifications). Leave empty for automatic: `gemma4:e2b` on Ollama, your chat model on an OpenAI-compatible server. Set it to pin a dedicated small model.

**Embeddings** (used for memory search) can run on a different backend. If your chat server has no embeddings endpoint, memory falls back to keyword search. To keep full semantic memory, route embeddings to Ollama (the wizard offers this automatically when it detects a server that cannot embed):

```json
{
  "embedding_provider": "ollama",
  "embedding_model": "nomic-embed-text"
}
```

Leave `embedding_provider` empty to use the same provider as chat. With no working embeddings, memory search degrades gracefully to keyword search.

<summary><strong>Speech Recognition (Whisper)</strong></summary>

#### Language Modes
- **Multilingual** (default, 99 languages): `"whisper_model": "medium"`
- **English Only** (slightly better English accuracy): `"whisper_model": "medium.en"`

#### Model Sizes
| Model | English | Multilingual | Download | VRAM | Speed |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|------|-------|
| Tiny | `tiny.en` | `tiny` | ~75 MB | ~1 GB | ~10x |
| Base | `base.en` | `base` | ~140 MB | ~1 GB | ~7x |
| Small | `small.en` | `small` | ~465 MB | ~2 GB | ~4x |
| **Medium** | `medium.en` | `medium` | ~1.5 GB | ~5 GB | ~2x |
| Large V3 Turbo | - | `large-v3-turbo` | ~1.5 GB | ~6 GB | ~8x |

Speed is relative to the original large model. [Source](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

#### GPU Acceleration (Windows)
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, Jarvis can use CUDA for much faster speech recognition. The Windows installer offers an optional CUDA download during setup. For development:
```bash
pip install nvidia-cublas-cu12 nvidia-cudnn-cu12
```
CUDA is detected automatically — no configuration needed.

#### Hallucination Filters
Whisper sometimes produces confident but false transcriptions during silence or background noise (e.g. news-show intros, music). Two thresholds filter these out before they reach the intent judge:

- `"whisper_min_confidence": 0.3` — drops segments whose `avg_logprob`-derived confidence falls below this value. Raise if you see low-confidence noise leaking through; lower if real speech is being dropped.
- `"whisper_no_speech_threshold": 0.5` — drops any segment whose `no_speech_prob` is at or above this value, regardless of `avg_logprob`. Catches the case where Whisper is confident about a hallucinated phrase but its own no-speech signal says the audio was silent. Applies to both the faster-whisper and MLX backends.

Both thresholds are exposed in the Settings window under *Whisper*.

<details>
<summary><strong>Voice Interface (Advanced)</strong></summary>

**LLM Intent Judge** - Jarvis uses a small LLM for intelligent voice intent classification (echo detection, query extraction, stop commands). On the default Ollama setup this is `gemma4:e2b`, installed automatically alongside your chosen chat model during setup. On an OpenAI-compatible provider the judge uses your served chat model instead, so there is nothing extra to install. The intent judge cannot be disabled but gracefully falls back to simpler text matching if the LLM server is unavailable.

**Tool Router** - When `"tool_selection_strategy": "llm"` (the default), Jarvis asks the fast model to pick which tools are relevant for each query, shrinking the tool catalogue the chat model sees. It's already warm and small enough not to stall the turn. Other strategies: `"keyword"` (fast, no LLM), `"embedding"` (nomic-embed-text), `"all"` (no filtering).

**Task-list Planner** - Before the agentic loop, Jarvis runs a short planning pass that decomposes multi-step queries into an ordered list of sub-tasks. For small models (`gemma4:e2b` class), each planned step is directly resolved to a concrete tool call without relying on the chat model to re-plan turn-by-turn. This significantly improves multi-step reliability. Config options:

```json
{
  "planner_enabled": true,          // set to false to disable the planner entirely
  "planner_timeout_sec": 6.0        // per-call timeout for plan and step-resolver LLM calls
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Small-Model Digest Passes (Advanced)</strong></summary>

Small chat models (~2B, e.g. `gemma4:e2b`) degrade sharply as their prompt grows. Jarvis runs two cheap distil passes to keep the prompt tight:

- **Memory digest** — boils diary + graph recall into a short relevance-filtered note before injecting it as background context.
- **Tool-result digest** — boils a raw tool payload (especially webSearch UNTRUSTED WEB EXTRACT blocks) into a short attributed fact note before it reaches the main reply model.

Both digest passes auto-enable for small models (≤7B) and stay off for large models. For small models, tool-result digest also prevents large fetch_web_page payloads from blowing the context window. Override in `~/.config/jarvis/config.json`:

```json
{
  "memory_digest_enabled": null,          // null = auto-on for SMALL, false to force off, true to force on
  "tool_result_digest_enabled": null,     // null = auto-on for SMALL, false to force off, true to force on
  "llm_digest_timeout_sec": 8.0           // tight ceiling shared by both passes
}
```

Field logs show `🧩 Memory digest: …` and `🧩 Tool digest: …` lines when a pass ran, so you can see when the substrate was replaced.

- 🧹 **Filler word removal** — optional LLM-powered cleanup removes "um", "uh", "like", "you know" while preserving meaning
- 📖 **Custom dictionary** — define `"wrong -> right"` replacements for jargon, names, and technical terms
- 📜 **History window** — browse, copy, or delete past dictations from the system tray
- 🎛️ **Easy setup** — configure dictation during the setup wizard or anytime in Settings (hotkey dropdown, filler removal toggle, custom dictionary editor)

Customise the hotkey in Settings or `config.json`:
```json
{
  "dictation_hotkey": "ctrl+alt",
  "dictation_filler_removal": true,
  "dictation_custom_dictionary": [
    "jarvis -> Jarvis",
    "pytorch -> PyTorch"
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** macOS requires Accessibility permissions for the global hotkey. Linux requires X11 (limited Wayland support).
