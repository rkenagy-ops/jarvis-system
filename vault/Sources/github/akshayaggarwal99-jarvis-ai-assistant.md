## The (short) story

Wispr Flow raised **$81 million** to build a voice dictation app.  
I got annoyed, spent 3 months of late nights building my own version, and open-sourced it.

That's it.  
No funding. No team. Just one stubborn developer who hates subscriptions.

This is what open source is supposed to be.

---

## Why people actually use it

- Hold **Fn** → speak → release → clean, punctuated text appears **anywhere**
- Removes "um", "like", all fillers automatically
- Fixes grammar, can rephrase, bullet-point, or even generate text
- Tiny actions already work ("open YouTube", "set 5-min timer")
- **Full Prompt Engineering:** Every behavior is customizable. Tweak how Jarvis formats mail, cleans dictation, or behaves as an assistant.
- **Fully offline** with local **Whisper** or **NVIDIA Parakeet** (via Sherpa-ONNX)
- **100% Private, Blazingly Fast** support for local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- Or use cloud speed with Deepgram + Gemini (1M tokens/day free) — Deepgram requests default to `mip_opt_out=true`

**Zero tracking. Zero telemetry. Zero bullshit.**

## Jarvis vs $700M startups

| | **Jarvis** | The $700M one |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 💰 Price | **Free forever** | $10–24/month |
| 🔇 Offline / Local | **Yes (Whisper + Parakeet)** | No |
| 🔓 Open Source | **Yes (MIT)** | No |
| 📡 Telemetry | **None** | ??? |
| 👨‍💻 Built by | **1 guy at 2am** | VC money |

## Quick setup (30 seconds)

1. Download & open the app
2. **Go Local (Recommended for privacy):**  
   - Settings → Transcription → Enable **Local Model**
   - Choose **Whisper** (tiny/base/small) or **Parakeet** (NVIDIA's 600M param model)
   - Settings → AI Models → Enable **Ollama** (requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed)
3. **Or Go Cloud (Recommended for speed/accuracy):**
   - Paste free Deepgram + Gemini keys
4. Hold Fn and talk

That's literally it.

## 🦙 Ollama (Local LLM) Support

Jarvis now supports running any LLM locally via Ollama. It's fast, private, and free.

1.  **Install Ollama:** [Download here](https://ollama.com)
2.  **Pull a model:**
    ```bash
    # LFM2 (optimized for speed)
    ollama pull sam860/LFM2:1.2b

    # Llama 3 (standard)
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
3.  **Enable in Jarvis:**
    - Settings → AI Models → Enable **Use Ollama**
    - Select your model from the dropdown (Jarvis auto-detects them!)

### ⚡ Performance Note

Running models locally depends heavily on your hardware.
- **Enabled AI Post-Processing:** Adds ~1-3s latency on typical M1/M2 chips.
- **Disabled AI Post-Processing:** Instant transcription.
- **High-End Hardware:** M1/M2/M3 Max/Ultra chips are nearly instant.

**For Lightning Fast Performance:**
If speed is critical, use **Deepgram + Gemini** (Cloud) or **Local Whisper + Gemini Flash**, which are significantly faster than local LLMs on standard hardware.
