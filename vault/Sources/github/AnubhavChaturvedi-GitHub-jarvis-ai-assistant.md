## What it does

J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a Python voice assistant inspired by Iron Man. You speak, it understands the intent, runs the right module, and answers out loud. It is built as separate, swappable subsystems rather than one giant script, so you can use only the parts you need.

## Features

| Module | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| `NetHyTechSTT` | Custom speech to text engine, no paid API required |
| `TextToSpeech` | Natural spoken replies |
| `Brain` / `co_brain.py` | Language model reasoning and conversation memory |
| `Real_Time` | Live web search so answers are not limited to training data |
| `TextToImage` | Generate images from a spoken prompt |
| `Vision` | Camera capture and image understanding |
| `Automation` | Open apps, control the desktop, run system tasks |
| `Whatsapp_automation` | Send WhatsApp messages hands free |
| `Weather_Check` | Live weather by location |
| `Time_Operations` | Alarms, reminders and scheduling |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- A working microphone and speakers
- Google Chrome (used by the browser automation modules)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnubhavChaturvedi-GitHub/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
cd jarvis-ai-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run it

```bash
python jarvis.py
```

Prefer a window over a terminal:

```bash
python ui.py
```

## Usage

Say the wake word, then speak naturally:

- "What is the weather in Bangalore?"
- "Open Chrome and search for transformer architecture"
- "Generate an image of a red sports car at sunset"
- "Send a WhatsApp message to Rahul saying I am running late"
- "What is happening in the news right now?"
